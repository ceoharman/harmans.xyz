  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>I learned a lot for this time, in regards to the how to solve the real problems</p>
  <p><strong>so what I mean by that is</strong> learn in a way that I need to understand the core concept on why some of the things are done like that </p>
  <p><em>for example,</em> In the css-excercise module 2 there was a way of solving the problem in few code but I took literlally more lines in order to solve that problem</p>
  <p>this was something that made me more humble, I thought i solve the problem but I could see why it was done in different way and that is the key lesson that I need to understand.</p>
