    <h1>Intro - Towards Greatness</h1>
    <p>Today is March 5, 2024 I started making my portfolio website, which is kind of practice for me to learn html, css and javascript</p>
    <h2> What I learned</h2>
    <p><em>Here are the things that I learned Today</em></p>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Intro to CSS</h3></li>
        <p>Finally I started learning the CSS that can help me to give the idea on how to build the structure of the website <strong>NICE</strong></p>
        <p>It was frustating to practice the CSS because It took me more than 1 hour to figure out why my styles.css was not link to the HTML</p>
        <p>But here are some of the things I practiced and you can see too styling with <em><strong>External, Internal, Inline.</strong></em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><div>type selector - what ever thing come under the type will effect in this selector</div></li>
          <li><div class="class-selector>">selector</div></li>
          <li>ID Selectors</li>
          <li>the grouping selector</li>
          <li>chaining selectors</li>
          <li>descendant combinator</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Later I learned the properties to start with</p>
        <ul>
          <li>color</li>
          <li>background color</li>
          <li>font-family</li>
          <li>font-size</li>
          <li>font-weight</li>
          <li>text-align</li>
          <li>image height and width</li>
        </ul>
      <li><h3>After Effects</h3></li>
        <p>I really believe in order to build the uncovering.co media channel I really need to learn the after effects.</p>
        <p>This will help me to buiild the game and have higher production which will eventually helps make me quality content for my viewers</p>
        <p>at the same time I'm worried for the <em><strong>OpenAI Sora</strong></em>, The reason being that thing can saturate the market for the quality content makers</p>
        <p>but at the same time helps me to build the quality animations at the best part</p>
      <li><h3>viralbytes.xyz</h3></li>
        <p>My other project to build the agency that solves the problem of businesses getting quality animators.</p>
        <p>In order to built succesfull agency, I need to become the good coder and motion designer so that I can lead the team in better way and can get more business</p>
        <p>It took me 8 years to realize that I'm more happy when I'm doing anything related to the tech, coding or making content</p>
        <p>That's why I want to build the business around it.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>My thoughts</h2>
      <p>My brain is really saying that it will take me another 1 year to blow up on YouTube and only then I will be able to make the viralbytes.xyz successful</p>
      <p>The reason being personal life stress that I really wish on internet, the other one is I'm stuck in the job that I cannot leave right now and yes it is not relate to the money but some other major problem</p>
      <p>But all I want is by the end of this year I at least has 10K subs on the uncovering.co YouTube channel and at least 1 client for the viralbytes.xyz and for my personal career to get the job in the tech industry</p>
      <p>One of the reason I want <strong>Job</strong>, I love working for the other people and it pushes me to build for other people and learn lessons that I apply on my side project, Also it makes me more hungry person</p>
